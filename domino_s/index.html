                <h1>What We Need - More Choice. More Fun. </h1><br>

                No matter what the situation, pizza always helps. Especially a pizza that gives you the freedom to choose your toppings - from paneer, crisp capsicum, onion, grilled mushroom, golden corn, black olives, fresh tomato, red paprika, jalapeno, paneer tikka and extra cheese to non-veg toppings such as pepper barbeque chicken, peri-peri chicken, grilled chicken rasher, chicken sausage or chicken tikka- the options are almost endless, anything and everything you can think of that too on top of the crust of your choice - New hand-tossed crust, wheat thin crust, cheese burst crust, classic hand-tossed crust or a fresh pan pizza. Because just like a pizza, Domino's understands you.<br><br>

                And to shoo away those end-of-the-month blues while placing your order with our pizza restaurant, check out the everyday pizzas from pizza mania combos with everyday value offer of 2 pizzas starting at just ₹99 (regular size) and ₹199 (medium size) each.

                The icing on the cake or more aptly the extra cheese on your already fabulous pizza is that Domino’s takes only half an hour for its pizza delivery service. Don’t believe us? Time it if you please. With 1250+ stores present all over India, you can have a Domino’s pizza even while traveling on a train. Yes, you are reading it right, you can enjoy pizza on train too.<br><br>

                So stop googling for the “pizza shops near me” and order from your nearest pizza outlet to have a hot box of pizza on your table in the next 30 minutes, or berth at the next halting station.
